# If paperless won't find documents added to your consume folder, it
# might not be able to automatically detect filesystem changes. In
# that case, specify a polling interval in seconds here, which will
# then cause paperless to periodically check your consumption
# directory for changes. This will also disable listening for file
# system changes with inotify.

# Defaults to 0, which disables polling and uses filesystem notifications.
PAPERLESS_CONSUMER_POLLING=5

# If consumer polling is enabled, sets the maximum number of times
# paperless will check for a file to remain unmodified. If a file's
# modification time and size are identical for two consecutive checks,
